## Introduction / status

Reworked from the great repo by yukulehe/gazpar2mqtt (who also provided a large part of the docu).
Main differences are in the login method, now using virtual browser (old method still does not work), and allowing to export to HA Long Term Statistics
- no verification if the now 2+-year old code from yukulehe/gazpar2mqtt is still valid **in its entirety**, bits and pieces may not work perfectly anylonger
- Not yet tested
  - Grafana dashboard template
  - Cost calculation from prices file

For usage and installation etc. see [DOCUMENTATION](https://github.com/vingerha/gazpar_2_mqtt/wiki)
